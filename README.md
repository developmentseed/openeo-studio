# Eopf-Code-Editor

A web application built with Vite and React for Eopf-Code-Editor

## Installation and Usage

The steps below will walk you through setting up your own instance of the project.

### Install Project Dependencies

To set up the development environment for this website, you'll need to install the following on your system:

- [Node](http://nodejs.org/) (see version in [.nvmrc](.nvmrc)) (To manage multiple node versions we recommend [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) Install using corepack (`corepack enable pnpm`)

### Install Application Dependencies

If you use [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), activate the desired Node version:

```sh
nvm install
```

Install Node modules:

```sh
pnpm install
```

## Usage

### Environment Configuration

The application uses [dot.env](https://vite.dev/guide/env-and-mode#env-files) files with environment variables for configuration. A template file `.env.example` is provided as a template.

To configure the application:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Modify the `.env` file with your specific configuration values
3. Never modify `.env.example` directly as it serves as documentation

### Starting the app

```sh
pnpm dev
```

Compiles the sass files, javascript, and launches the server making the site available at `http://localhost:9000/`
The system will watch files and execute tasks whenever one of them changes.
The site will automatically refresh since it is bundled with livereload.

## Deployment

To prepare the app for deployment run:

```sh
pnpm build
```

or

```sh
pnpm stage
```

This will package the app and place all the contents in the `dist` directory.
The app can then be run by any web server.

**When building the site for deployment provide the base url trough the `VITE_BASE_URL` environment variable. Omit the leading slash. (E.g. <https://example.com>)**
